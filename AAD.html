    <ul>
      <li><strong>Context:</strong> The <a href="http://aad.archives.gov/aad/" target="_blank">AAD</a> is administered by the U.S. National Archives and Records Administration (NARA). 
        It was initiated in 2003 in order to enhance the accessibility of electronic and born-digital records by the general population. The mission of the NARA is to conserve and avail the permanent files of the federal government, 
        and AAD helps toward that end with searchable, structured data bases of data, and not just digitized pictures. This sets it apart as compared to the traditional archives or scanned document libraries.</li>
      <li><strong>Users:</strong> Professional historians who study the policy of the U.S. government often use AAD, which is also popular with genealogists using military and immigration records to trace family histories. 
        School teachers who use primary sources in their classroom activities, reporters who perform research about government activity and ordinary citizens who are interested in knowing more about their family members or past developments. 
        Its users are between those who are very technical researchers and casual learners.</li>
      <li><strong>Content:</strong> AAD holds over 85 million records of over 50 archival series. Among the collections are World War II Army enlistment records, 
        Vietnam and Korean wars casualty reports, lists of immigration passengers, economic and census data, among various administrative data of federal agencies. 
        All records can be analyzed by targeted searches and download in bulk (e.g., name of a person, service number, date, location).</li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Unique / Interesting Features</h2>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Electronic Records</div>
        <p>In contrast to other archives that are based on scanned images, AAD pays great attention to structured electronic records that are generated by agencies in the first place. This layout permits users to look at specific values in categories. 
          Instead of scrolling through pictures or PDFs, (e.g. a service number of a soldier) This emphasis on born-digital material shows a progressive attitude of NARA towards digital preservation.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Specialized Search</div>
        <p>AAD offers fielded search facilities. The query can be made either by name, military serial number, geographic location or by date range. 
          As an example, a genealogist can find the immigration records of a last name and year of arrival, and a historian can find all the casualties of a specific conflict zone. 
          This organized search is more accurate and effective than the tools with only a keyword search.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Transparency</div>
        <p>AAD increases transparency and accountability by ensuring that government data is given freely. Scholars are able to check facts by their own, journalists can use official data in their writing, 
          and the general population can become informed on policy decisions and results. These data sets are open source, and downloadable, and suitable to be reused as a part of the open government data concept.</p>
      </div>
    </div>

    <h2>Pros & Cons</h2>
    <ul>
      <li><strong style="color:var(--leaf);">Pros:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Free and open access:</em> AAD is free of charge and does not need a login so that people can have equal access to information.</li>
          <li><em>Structured data:</em> The records are grouped together into fields, and they are thus suitable to be further analysed and incorporated into research projects.</li>
          <li><em>Extensive scope:</em> AAD encompasses various facets of U.S. history with millions of records on various wars, immigration events and administrative actions.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
      <li><strong style="color:var(--spine);">Cons:</strong>
        <ul>
          <li><em>Outdated interface:</em> The design is simple and that can turn away ordinary users that are used to contemporary websites.</li>
          <li><em>Complex datasets:</em> Certain sets must be read in the background to correctly be interpreted by inexperienced users.</li>
          <li><em>Coverage limits:</em> Certain electronic records can be accessed; however, numerous historical records are still available only as physical documents, as scanned images outside AAD, or microfilmed.</li>
        </ul>
      </li>
    </ul>

    <h2>Suggestions for Improvement</h2>
    <div class="cards">
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Modern UI</div>
        <p>AAD could use a full interface refresh. Adopting a contemporary, mobile‑responsive design would make accessibility touch‑friendly, and record presentation could be more attractive with filtered tables. 
          More legible type and greater color contrasts would improve the experience during long research sessions by making the text more readable.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Guided Tutorials</div>
        <p>Including additional resources like tutorials, walkthroughs, or sample queries would facilitate learning. For instance, a guided search wizard could assist a genealogy researcher in locating a relative’s enlistment record. 
          Displayed contextual help icons beside complicated fields would detail what information each contains, enhancing user‑friendliness of the AAD for novice users.</p>
      </div>
      <div class="flashcard">
        <div class="card-title">Data Formats</div>
        <p>At present, downloads are primarily offered as text or CSV files. Integrating modern research tools and programming languages would be simplified if export options also included JSON and XML. 
          Providing bulk downloads or APIs would also facilitate large-scale analyses across several datasets.</p>
